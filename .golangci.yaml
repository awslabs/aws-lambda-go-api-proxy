    - exported func * returns unexported type *, which can be annoying to use
    # can be removed in the development phase
    # - (comment on exported (method|function|type|const)|should have( a package)? comment|comment should be of the form)
    # not for the active development - can be removed in the stable phase
    - should have a package comment, unless it's in another file for this package
    - don't use an underscore in package name
    # errcheck: Almost all programs ignore errors on these functions and in most cases it's ok
    - Error return value of .((os\.)?std(out|err)\..*|.*Close|.*Flush|os\.Remove(All)?|.*printf?|os\.(Un)?Setenv|.*Rollback). is not checked
    - should check returned error before deferring
